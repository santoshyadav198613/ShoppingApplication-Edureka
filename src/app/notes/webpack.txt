What is webpack
1. It is bundler, async module loader and it gives us the development server.

use "ng eject" to take webpack configuration file in root directory.

3. To create a prod build :
use "npm run build" -- this will not give us minified file
use "npm run build:p" this will give us minified file.

To install a local server :
1. "npm install -g http-server"
