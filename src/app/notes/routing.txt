why routing is needed.
1. Navigating within application
2. Display different UI based on URL
3. pass some data in URL

ui.router is third party library to achive the routing functionality.

How to implememt routing:
1. import and register the RouterModule
2. use forRoot method to register the different navigation in our app.
3. use routerLink to assigne different URLS
4. place <router-outlet> on appComponent


RoutingModule
1. We can seperate the code related to routing configuration, by creating a new module 
and making routing configuration changes in that module.

Feature Modules:
We can place all components/directices/pipes and routing configuration and services related to a 
single feature together by using feature module.

Shared Module:
this will place all common modules in single file.


Router service is used to navigate from TS files.

Guards:
1. Restrict the access to unauthorized area.

a. canActivate:
this auth guard will check if you can access the URL.
you can add multiple guards to this property in routing configuration.
