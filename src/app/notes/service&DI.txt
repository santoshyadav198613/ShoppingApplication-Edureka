1. Services:
    What is a Service:
        A common class which will provide some functionality.
    why service is important:
        1. Reusability
        2. Code seperation
        3. Business logiC/rules are seperated
        4. Get the data from multiple APIs
        5. loosely coupled system


Creating a service in Angualr:
1. ng g service <service_name>
2. @Injectable() this decortaor with provide the class a a service
3. add the methods required.
4. Register the service, using app.module.ts , add an entry in
providers array.
5. Using the service


DI (Dependency Injection)
1. it helps us to create loosely coupled system
2. the class dont need to create a instance
3. Widely used Design Pattern

Angular DI framework:
1. Has its on IOC(Inversion of Control).
2. No overhead like other frameworks

Singleton:
1. You get a single instance of class across application
2. Can be used to share some common data.
